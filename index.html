         <p> In the restaurant, a menu is a list of food and beverages offered to
         customers and the prices. A menu may be à la carte – which presents a
         list of options from which customers choose – or table d'hôte, in which
         case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered. Menus may be printed
         on paper sheets provided to the diners, put on a large poster or display board
         inside the establishment, displayed outside the restaurant, or put on a digital
         screen. Since the late 1990s, some restaurants have put their menus online.
         Menus are also often a feature of very formal meals other than in restaurants,
         for example at weddings. In the 19th and 20th centuries printed menus were often
         used for society dinner-parties in homes; indeed this was their original use in Europe.
